I would advice caution, and be prepared for a fight even if they recognize that you're one of them.  That you pursue this task means I can trust you to do what's right.  They're preying upon people just as the Order has for decades, and not even the threat of humanity's extinction has swayed them.  It's unfortunate, as killing each other is the last thing we should be doing in times like these, but they must be brought to justice.\n君も自分の所属する教団の暗黒面を見ただろう。奴らから仲間だと認識されていようが、戦う覚悟をしておくことだ。君がこの仕事を遂行しようとしているなら、私も君を正しい人として信頼できる。奴らは何十年も前から人々を食い物にし、人類が絶滅しようが気にしない。こんな状況で人間同士殺し合うなんて残念なことだが、奴らには正義の鉄槌を下さなければ。"
